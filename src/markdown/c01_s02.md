# Binary Number Representations

Few things are naturally represented in binary, and numbers are one of those things. We really only need to make one small tweak in our natural way of thinking to understand how numbers are encoded in binary: We need to think of numbers in terms of two symbols as opposed to 10. In other words, we need to learn to think in a base 2 number system instead of base 10.
