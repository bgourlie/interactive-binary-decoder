      The purpose of this guide is to foster an intuitive understanding of how
      floating point numbers work. If you're looking for formal definitions and
      specifications, you will not find them here. The good news is, you don't
      need to know these things to understand how and why floats differ from
      integer types, and why they sometimes behave in unexpected ways.
